# Node-RED

> Low-code programming for event-driven applications!

Node-RED is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways.

It provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range of nodes in the palette that can be deployed to its runtime in a single-click.

**By default, the Node-RED editor is not secured. Anyone can use the editor, and deploy changes. The documentation provides useful info on [securing Node-RED](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/runtime/securing-node-red).**
